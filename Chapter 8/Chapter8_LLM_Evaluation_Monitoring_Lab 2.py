# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Creating the Evaluation Dataset
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **What we're doing:** Building a structured evaluation dataset that pairs each question with its "ground truth" (correct) answer. This is essential for measuring how well the LLM performs.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **How it works:**
# MAGIC 1. **`generate_ground_truth_answer()` function**: Extracts the expected answer from the context based on complexity:
# MAGIC    - *Simple questions*: First sentence of context is the answer
# MAGIC    - *Moderate questions*: First two sentences combined
# MAGIC    - *Complex questions*: Full context needed for complete answer
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Dataset structure**: Each record contains:
# MAGIC    - `id`: Unique identifier (e.g., "product_info_1")
# MAGIC    - `question`: The user's question
# MAGIC    - `context`: Background information the LLM should use
# MAGIC    - `ground_truth`: The correct answer we expect
# MAGIC    - `category` and `complexity`: For stratified analysis
# MAGIC    - `expected_tokens`: Estimated token count for cost prediction
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Why this matters:** Without ground truth answers, we can't objectively measure if the LLM is giving correct responses. This dataset becomes our "answer key" for evaluation.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Generating Simulated Production Traffic
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **What we're doing:** Creating synthetic inference logs that mimic what a real production LLM endpoint would generate over 7 days of operation.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **How the `generate_traffic_data()` function works:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Time distribution**: Generates timestamps over 7 days with realistic patterns:
# MAGIC    - More requests during business hours (9 AM - 6 PM)
# MAGIC    - Fewer requests on weekends and nights
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Latency simulation** using normal distribution:
# MAGIC    ```python
# MAGIC    base_latency = {"simple": 200, "moderate": 400, "complex": 800}
# MAGIC    latency = np.random.normal(base_latency, std_dev)
# MAGIC    ```
# MAGIC    - Simple queries: ~200ms average
# MAGIC    - Complex queries: ~800ms average
# MAGIC    - 5% of requests get artificial "spikes" (3-5x normal latency)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **Token usage**: Calculated based on complexity with random variation
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 4. **Error injection**: 2% of requests marked as "error" or "timeout" to simulate real failures
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Why this matters:** Real production data takes weeks to accumulate. Synthetic data lets us immediately practice monitoring, anomaly detection, and alerting without waiting.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC **How it works:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Create schema**: `spark.sql("CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS main.llm_monitoring_lab")`
# MAGIC    - Creates a namespace to organize our tables
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Convert and save**:

# MAGIC    spark.createDataFrame(pandas_df)  # Convert pandas → Spark DataFrame
# MAGIC    .write.mode("overwrite")          # Replace if exists
# MAGIC    .saveAsTable("catalog.schema.table")  # Save as managed Delta table

# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **Tables created**:
# MAGIC    - `evaluation_dataset`: Our Q&A pairs with ground truth answers
# MAGIC    - `traffic_data`: Synthetic production traffic logs
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Why Delta Lake?**
# MAGIC - **ACID transactions**: Safe concurrent reads/writes
# MAGIC - **Time travel**: Query previous versions with `VERSION AS OF`
# MAGIC - **Schema enforcement**: Prevents bad data from corrupting tables
# MAGIC - **Optimized queries**: Auto-compaction and Z-ordering for fast reads

# MAGIC # Part 2: Creating and Deploying the Model Serving Endpoint
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this section, we will:
# MAGIC 1. Register a foundation model for serving
# MAGIC 2. Create a Model Serving endpoint
# MAGIC 3. Configure inference tables for logging
# MAGIC 4. Test the endpoint with sample queries
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This endpoint will serve as our production Q&A system that we'll monitor and optimize throughout the lab.

# MAGIC ### Step 2.1: Configure Foundation Model API Access
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks provides **Foundation Model APIs** - pre-deployed, pay-per-token endpoints for popular LLMs. These are:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Immediately available** - no deployment required
# MAGIC - **Auto-scaling** - handles any traffic volume
# MAGIC - **Pay-per-token** - cost-effective for variable workloads
# MAGIC - **OpenAI-compatible** - easy integration with existing code
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We'll use the **Meta Llama 3.1 8B Instruct** model (`databricks-meta-llama-3-1-8b-instruct`), which is well-suited for Q&A tasks.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For inference table logging, we'll create a **custom proxy endpoint** that wraps the foundation model and enables request/response logging.

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Verifying the Foundation Model Endpoint
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **What we're doing:** Confirming that the Databricks Foundation Model API is accessible before we start sending queries.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **How it works:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **SDK endpoint check**: `w.serving_endpoints.get(name=ENDPOINT_NAME)`
# MAGIC    - Retrieves metadata about the endpoint
# MAGIC    - Confirms the endpoint exists and is in "READY" state
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **What we verify**:
# MAGIC    - Endpoint name matches our configuration
# MAGIC    - State is "READY" (not "PENDING" or "FAILED")
# MAGIC    - URL is correctly formed for API calls
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Foundation Models vs Custom Endpoints:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC | Aspect | Foundation Model | Custom Endpoint |
# MAGIC |--------|-----------------|-----------------|
# MAGIC | Provisioning | Always ready | Minutes to hours |
# MAGIC | Scaling | Automatic | Manual configuration |
# MAGIC | Billing | Pay-per-token | Pay for compute time |
# MAGIC | Customization | None | Fine-tuning possible |
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Why this matters:** Verifying the endpoint upfront prevents confusing errors later. If the endpoint isn't accessible, we want to know immediately rather than after running expensive evaluation jobs.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC
# MAGIC **What we're doing:** Running multiple queries to collect baseline performance data that will inform our monitoring thresholds.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **How it works:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Batch execution loop**:
# MAGIC    ```python

# MAGIC        time.sleep(1)  # Rate limiting to avoid throttling
# MAGIC    ```
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Metrics collected per query**:
# MAGIC    - `latency_ms`: End-to-end response time
# MAGIC    - `input_tokens`: Tokens in prompt (question + context)
# MAGIC    - `output_tokens`: Tokens in generated answer
# MAGIC    - `category` and `complexity`: For stratified analysis
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **Baseline statistics calculated**:
# MAGIC    - Mean, P50 (median), P95, P99 latency
# MAGIC    - Average token usage by complexity
# MAGIC    - Success rate
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Why baselines matter (Chapter 8 best practice):**
# MAGIC - **Threshold setting**: "Alert when latency > P95 baseline × 1.5"
# MAGIC - **Drift detection**: Compare current metrics to baseline
# MAGIC - **Capacity planning**: Predict costs based on token patterns
# MAGIC - **SLA definition**: Set realistic performance guarantees

# MAGIC ### Step 3.1: Configure MLflow LLM Evaluation
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **What we're doing:** Setting up custom evaluation scorers using MLflow's new GenAI API (MLflow 3.4+).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **How the new API works:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **`@scorer` decorator**: Creates a custom evaluation function
# MAGIC    ```python
# MAGIC    @scorer
# MAGIC    def groundedness(inputs: dict, outputs: str) -> int:
# MAGIC        # Use LLM-as-judge to score the output
# MAGIC        return score  # 1-5
# MAGIC    ```
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Function signature**: Scorers receive standardized parameters:
# MAGIC    - `inputs`: Dictionary with question, context, etc.
# MAGIC    - `outputs`: The model's generated response
# MAGIC    - `expectations`: Ground truth for comparison (optional)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **LLM-as-Judge pattern**: We use another LLM (Llama 70B) to evaluate responses
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Why the new API?**
# MAGIC - The old `make_genai_metric` is deprecated since MLflow 3.4.0
# MAGIC - New API is more flexible and Pythonic
# MAGIC - Better integration with MLflow's tracing and monitoring

# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Prepare data in new format**:

# MAGIC    c_score = answer_correctness(inputs=..., outputs=..., expectations=...)
# MAGIC    ```
# MAGIC    - Each scorer calls the judge LLM (Llama 70B)
# MAGIC    - Returns a score from 1-5
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **Log aggregate metrics**:

# MAGIC #### Running Traced Queries
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **What we're doing:** Executing queries through our `TracedQAAgent` to collect detailed timing data for each step of the pipeline.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **How the tracing works:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Trace ID generation**: Each query gets a unique ID for correlation:
# MAGIC    ```python
# MAGIC    trace_id = str(uuid.uuid4())[:8]  # e.g., "a1b2c3d4"
# MAGIC    ```
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Step-by-step timing**: Each pipeline step is timed:
# MAGIC    ```python
# MAGIC    start = time.time()
# MAGIC    result = self.preprocess_query(question)
# MAGIC    latency_ms = (time.time() - start) * 1000
# MAGIC    trace_record["steps"].append({"step": "preprocess", "latency_ms": latency_ms})
# MAGIC    ```
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **Pipeline steps traced**:
# MAGIC    | Step | What it does | Typical time |
# MAGIC    |------|-------------|--------------|
# MAGIC    | preprocess | Clean/normalize question | 1-5ms |
# MAGIC    | retrieve | Find relevant context | 5-20ms |
# MAGIC    | generate | LLM API call | 200-2000ms |
# MAGIC    | postprocess | Format response | 1-5ms |
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 4. **Trace log storage**: All traces stored in `traced_agent.trace_log` for analysis
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Why trace?** The LLM call typically dominates latency (>95%), but tracing helps identify when other steps become bottlenecks (e.g., slow retrieval from a vector database).

# MAGIC #### Comparing Optimized vs Baseline Performance
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **What we're doing:** Running the same queries with optimized prompts and comparing token usage, latency, and answer quality against our baseline.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **How the comparison works:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Run both versions** on the same questions:
# MAGIC    ```python
# MAGIC    baseline_result = query_qa_endpoint(question, context)  # Full prompts
# MAGIC    optimized_result = query_optimized(question, context, optimizer)  # Compressed
# MAGIC    ```
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Metrics compared**:
# MAGIC    | Metric | Baseline | Optimized | Goal |
# MAGIC    |--------|----------|-----------|------|
# MAGIC    | Input tokens | ~300 | ~150 | 50% reduction |
# MAGIC    | Output tokens | ~200 | ~100 | 50% reduction |
# MAGIC    | Latency | ~500ms | ~350ms | Lower is better |
# MAGIC    | Quality | 0.85 | 0.80+ | Minimal degradation |
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **Cost calculation**:
# MAGIC    ```python
# MAGIC    # Typical pricing: $0.002 per 1K tokens
# MAGIC    baseline_cost = baseline_tokens * 0.002 / 1000
# MAGIC    optimized_cost = optimized_tokens * 0.002 / 1000
# MAGIC    savings = (baseline_cost - optimized_cost) / baseline_cost * 100
# MAGIC    ```

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Generating the Review Report
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **What we're doing:** Creating a human-readable report that summarizes the review findings for stakeholders who may not be technical.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Report structure:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Executive Summary**: High-level health status
# MAGIC    - Overall health: HEALTHY / NEEDS ATTENTION / CRITICAL
# MAGIC    - Review period and sample size
# MAGIC    - One-line summary of key findings
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Key Metrics Table**: Current vs baseline comparison
# MAGIC    ```
# MAGIC    ✅ latency_p50: 245ms (baseline: 240ms, change: +2.1%)
# MAGIC    ⚠️ latency_p95: 890ms (baseline: 720ms, change: +23.6%)
# MAGIC    ✅ error_rate: 1.2% (baseline: 1.5%, change: -20.0%)
# MAGIC    ```
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **Active Alerts**: Any triggered alert rules
# MAGIC    - Severity level (CRITICAL/WARNING/INFO)
# MAGIC    - Rule that triggered
# MAGIC    - Specific message
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 4. **Recommendations**: Prioritized action items
# MAGIC    - CRITICAL: Address immediately
# MAGIC    - HIGH: Address within 24 hours
# MAGIC    - MEDIUM: Address within 1 week
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Why structured reports matter (Chapter 8 best practice):**
# MAGIC - Executives need summaries, not raw data
# MAGIC - Consistent format enables trend tracking over time
# MAGIC - Recommendations drive action, not just awareness

# MAGIC ### Step 8.3: Create Evaluation Dataset Versioning
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **What we're doing:** Saving a timestamped version of our evaluation dataset so we can reproduce results and track changes over time.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **How versioning works:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Generate version string** from timestamp:
# MAGIC    ```python
# MAGIC    version = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
# MAGIC    # Result: "20241130_143022"
# MAGIC    ```
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Save versioned Delta table**:
# MAGIC    ```python
# MAGIC    versioned_table_name = f"{CATALOG}.{SCHEMA}.evaluation_dataset_v{version}"
# MAGIC    spark_df.write.saveAsTable(versioned_table_name)
# MAGIC    # Creates: main.llm_monitoring_lab.evaluation_dataset_v20241130_143022
# MAGIC    ```
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **Log to MLflow** for discoverability:
# MAGIC    ```python
# MAGIC    mlflow.log_param("dataset_version", version)
# MAGIC    mlflow.log_param("dataset_table", versioned_table_name)
# MAGIC    mlflow.log_artifact("eval_dataset.csv")  # Downloadable copy
# MAGIC    ```
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Why version datasets?**
# MAGIC - **Reproducibility**: "What data did we use for the March evaluation?"
# MAGIC - **Debugging**: "Did the dataset change, or did the model regress?"
# MAGIC - **Compliance**: Audit trails for regulated industries
# MAGIC - **A/B testing**: Compare model performance on identical datasets
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Best practice:** Always version both the dataset AND the evaluation results together. Link them via MLflow run IDs.
